# PROJECT SETUP 
Description
The repository contains a React application that displays a list of bots you can use to custom build your own Bot Army. 

# Core Features
As a user, you are able to:
- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
  - Sort bots by their health, damage or armor.
  - When you enlist a bot it will be removed from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Filter bots by their class. You can select a few filters at the same time.
